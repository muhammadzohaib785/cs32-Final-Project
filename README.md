My CS Final Projec


My Idea:

For my final CS project, I want to build a map-based app that helps users find the closest available parking spot to their destination. The app will show real-time availability, display parking charges, and indicate the maximum allowed parking time for each spot. My goal is to make parking easier and more efficient by giving users the information they need to make quick, informed decisionsâ€”especially in busy areas where parking can be a hassle.
